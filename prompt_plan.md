 # 🧠 Prompt Plan – Flashcards Chrome Extension

## Goal:
Use an LLM (like ChatGPT or Gemini) to plan, structure, and debug parts of the project.

---

## Prompts Used:

### 💡 Initial Planning
> "What are good features for a flashcard extension that grabs highlighted text?"

### 📁 Folder Structure
> "What should the folder layout be for a modular Chrome extension project?"

### 🔎 Debugging Help
> "Why does my content script not push selected text into the popup?"

### 🎨 Styling Suggestions
> "Give me a modern, minimal CSS layout for a popup interface with rounded corners, shadows, and icons."

---

## LLM Use Summary

The LLM helped me:
- Brainstorm initial features and phases
- Create testable ADTs and suggest structure for Flashcard class
- Debug content script issues (Chrome storage/local context)
- Design a cleaner UI and animations for better user experience

Although the LLM provided guidance, all implementation and testing were done manually for learning and skill development.
