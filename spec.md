# ðŸ“˜ Spec â€” Flashcards Chrome Extension Midterm

## Overview

This Chrome Extension allows users to highlight text from any webpage and instantly turn it into a flashcard. The flashcards are saved locally and can be reviewed, navigated, deleted, and exported to JSON from the extension popup.

The focus of the project was to apply sound software engineering practices: modular design, testing, version control, and clean, maintainable code.
